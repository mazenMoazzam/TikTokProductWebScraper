# Tiktok Product Webscraper
Made this for reselling purposes on TikTok shop. Web scraper extracts the most trending/most brought products on tiktok shop. Used beautifulSoup library for webscraper and extracted the row class name to iterate through each row to scrape the name of the product, popularity, category, etc.

Will utilize cronjobs to webscrape content every week to receive updates on product trends to ensure accurate updates.
